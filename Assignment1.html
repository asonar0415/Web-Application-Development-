        <p>Anushka Sonar</p>
        <p>I am from Pune, Maharashtra, India</p>
        <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Application, which provided me with a solid foundation in programming concepts. During my studies, I gained experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating several small-scale web projects. I've also worked on a team project developing a responsive website for a local business, where I focused on front-end implementation and basic PHP for form handling. While I'm still early in my professional web development journey, I'm eager to expand my skills and take on more complex projects.</p>
        <p>Its my 2nd Year at IIT</p>
